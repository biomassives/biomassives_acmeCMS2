This project makes use of extra security methods to ensure
that what you create can be easily regenerated and does not
fail itself off the internet easily.  

Why do websites and other presentation layers within apps remain
conjoined with their authoring kits? the assumption of this software
is that the average user is capable of understanding how to keep her 
security approaches updated, and we do do so by sharing an open source
free software based authoring layer, not designed for capitol gain, but
for the joy of sharing and software elegance.

please fork and share back, pull requests are appreciated and pondered for
colloborative future outgrowths of this project.

thank you
